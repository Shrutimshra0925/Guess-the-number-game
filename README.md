# Guess-the-number-game
This is a simple Java console application for a number guessing game. The game randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target number.
